<p>What is up my friend?</p>

<p>I would like you to come and build something with me. Don't know what it is yet, but we'll
figure that out together.</p>

<p>Please <%= link_to 'accept this invitation', accept_invitation_url(@resource, :invitation_token => @resource.invitation_token) %>
to colapp, a collaborative application we are building together for great awesomeness.
</p>

<p>If you don't want to accept the invitation, please ignore this email.<br />
Your account won't be created until you access the link above and set your password.
But come on, this is the next big thing. You need in.</p>

<p>Now here is a picture of people collaborating. Enjoy. See you soon.</p>
